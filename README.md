# InferGPT: your local personalised AI agent

 primary focus is .

InferGPT's mission is to be an AI that knows you better than your best friend. A system that personalises to who you are and what you care about. We want to build something that can:

üîó Ingest data about you from various sources (with your permission of course)  
üí° Have deep and personal conversations without having to answer lots of questions - it will already infer your needs, make personalised recommendations and remember all your conversations.  
üéØ Help you set and keep track of goals. 
üèóÔ∏è Carry out tasks: this is an agent after all - it will go away and action stuff for you!  
üîÆ Predict what you need before you need it!  

We aim to be able to answer complex questions that require a deep understanding of someone to effectively answer, such as:
1) How can i be better with my finances?
2) I'm trying to lose weight but its not working, why? 
3) I'm learning to code, can you create a tailored learning plan?
