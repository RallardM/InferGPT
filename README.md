# InferGPT: your local personalised AI agent

InferGPT's primary focus is to be an AI that knows you better than your best friend.

Our mission is to provide an AI that personalises to who you are and what you care about. We want to build a system that can:

üîó Ingest data about you from various sources (with your permission of course)  
üí° Have deep and personal conversations without having to answer lots of questions - it will already infer your needs, make personalised recommendations and remember all your conversations.  
üèóÔ∏è Carry out tasks: this is an agent after all - it will go away and action stuff for you!  
üîÆ Predict what you need before you need it!
